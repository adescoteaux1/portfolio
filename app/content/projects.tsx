      "Arenius is a carbon accounting web application designed for small-to-medium sized businesses. It allows users to track their carbon footprint, manage their emissions, and take steps to reduce their impact on the environment. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for businesses to input their data and receive insights into their carbon emissions. Company bank transactions are imported from their 3rd-party accounting software and their carbon footprint is estimated based on assigned carbon emission factors.",

              This app was developed for a real client as part of Generate at
              Northeastern, a student-led product development studio. As one of
              two tech leads, I managed a team of 5 engineers and created
              tickets, reviewed code, and engineered features. We worked
              alongside a team of designers, helping to bring their visuals to
              life in a responsive and efficient web application.
            </p>
            <p>
              The engineering team began by building the backend in Go and
              integrating with external APIs. Specifically, we integrated with
              Xero, an accounting API, and Climatiq, a carbon accounting API for
              estimating carbon emissions based on financial transactions. Once
              the design team created Figma mockups, we built the front-end
              using React, Next.js, Tailwind, and the shadcn component library.

          This was my first time learning about the carbon accounting space and
          making a data-focused app that revolves around visualizations. It was
          very rewarding to work on this project with my team and complete all
          of the features that we set out to accomplish.
